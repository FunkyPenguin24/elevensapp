A fun card game made in flutter

## How to play

There is a max of 9 cards on the table at once, and you must match two cards together that add up to 11, or a Jack a Queen and a King.

When you get rid of two (or three) cards, all the selected cards are replaced by others in the deck. Once the deck is empty, you win.

If there are cards remaining in the deck but no moves can be made, you have lost the game and must restart.
